## How create a simple CHAT using WebSocket?

This project was designed to demonstrate the utilization of `socket` and `goroutine`. It leverages these technologies to establish a CHAT system between a server and a client


## Why use WebSocket?

WebSocket is bidirectonal, a full-duplex protocol that is used in the same scenario of client-server communication, unlike HTTP. It is a stateful protocol, which means the connection between client and server will keep alive until it is terminated by either party(client or server). Afer closing the connection by either of the client and server, the connection is terminated from both ends.

For this reason is highly recommended for the development of CHAT applications, gaming applications, arrnd real-time web applications.

In this project, we provide a basic implementation of WebSocket in Golang to demostrate how this implementation functions in practice.
